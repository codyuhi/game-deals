```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files

```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

_This project needs to be rebuilt and maintained properly as security updates are released for dependencies._

- Rebuild base app
